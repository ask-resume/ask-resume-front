## 1. Why is it failing to produce results?

If you enter your resume and generate results, a server error (HTTP status 500) may occur.

Sorry bro, This error occurs because the GPT server blocks requests when a large number of requests come in. <br />
Therefore, it has been implemented so that a re-request can be made when the issue occurs.

We will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Really sorry for the inconvenience.
